# RegenPass: A POAP Platform for Dynamic AR Event Engagement

## Short Description
RegenPass is a next-generation POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) platform that transforms event participation into a dynamic, interactive digital experience. By combining geo-location, augmented reality (AR), AI-powered booth recognition, and cross-chain minting via CCIP/Chainlink, RegenPass enables attendees to collect unique, branded POAPs that serve as verifiable proof of their participation—minted on the ideal blockchain network based on the event booth detected.

## Key Features
- **Seamless Onboarding & Geo-Verification**  
  Quickly register and verify attendance using geo-location to ensure participants are within designated event zones.

- **Immersive AR Experience**  
  Engage with dynamic AR assets as soon as the camera opens, enhancing the in-person experience with interactive digital overlays.

- **AI-Powered Booth Recognition**  
  Utilize AI to process booth banners and accurately determine the associated chain (e.g., Chainlink or Base), which in turn dictates the style of the dynamic AR POAP displayed.

- **Cross-Chain POAP Minting via CCIP/Chainlink**  
  Initiate a mint function on Sepolia that leverages CCIP to direct the actual minting on the target blockchain as determined by the recognized booth, ensuring optimal cross-chain interoperability.

- **Secure, Real-Time Transaction & Wallet Updates**  
  Conduct secure on-chain transactions with immediate updates to the user’s digital wallet, providing verifiable proof of attendance in real time.

- **Robust Error Handling & User Feedback**  
  Offer clear prompts for re-scanning or retrying in cases of unrecognized inputs or transaction failures, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Relevant Use-Cases
- **Event Attendance Verification**  
  Provide a reliable and engaging method for participants to prove their attendance at events, conferences, and expos.

- **Brand Activation & Engagement**  
  Allow brands to create custom POAP experiences (e.g., Chainlink or Base-themed) that boost interaction and leave lasting digital impressions.

- **Community Building & Gamification**  
  Foster community spirit and friendly competition by enabling users to collect, display, and share their unique POAPs across social channels.

- **Marketing & Promotional Campaigns**  
  Enhance event marketing by offering exclusive, collectible digital rewards that can double as discount coupons or access passes for future events.
